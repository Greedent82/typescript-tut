Brilliant! You now know the building blocks of type assignment. Now lets look at arrays 

In js, arrays can be defined as the following:

```javascript 
let count = [1 , 2 , 3]
```

But how would be define the array with types? Well...

```typescript 
let count: number[] = []
```

This will let typescript know that your array is an array of numbers!
