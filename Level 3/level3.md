You might be thinking "Well, that's all well and good applying one type to an array, I'd typically only want one type of data in one. What about objects where I'd likely need several?" I mean, you probably weren't but you sure are now!

before we'd define objects like we would in js, we first need to assign each key a type like so

```typescript 
type iceCream = {
  flavour: string;
  ranking: number; 
};
```
From there, it won't be anything you haven't seen before! You can then go ahead and create an object!

Go ahead and see if you can pass the level 3 test. As you've likely found in JavaScript, if you can master types, arrays, objects, and functions, there really is no limit to what you can come up with! Best of luck typing some scripts! :)
